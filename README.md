# Lottery-Simulator-Pega4-
Program that uses inner classes to simulate a gambling game which is the Pega4. Rules are simple, if the number the user enters matches the random number generated by the program, the User wins! if not then better luck next time. 

Using inner class discussed in class ,simulate that you are playing 4:

The program  should  continue  running  until one of these  two situations happen :    

            1. Press  Ok on  the  JOptionPane  ( if you  press  the button it  should  say  " You lost  !!!").
            2. If the number entered comes out on the four hit you won.
            
The interval is every  2  seconds and that makes a "beep" .

Note : Investigate  how to  generate  numbers  at  random .

The output would be  as  follows :

-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------

Enter a number between 1000 and 9999: 3329
